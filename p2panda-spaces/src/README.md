This crate provides access-controlled and encrypted data spaces for dynamic groups of users. This
feature set is achieved through an integration of p2panda-access and p2panda-encryption. Re-usable
groups can be added to one or many spaces, each space has it's own private identifier and
encryption scope. The "Data Encryption" scheme is used which provides post-compromise security and
optional forward secrecy.

Read more about the underlying [groups CRDT](https://docs.rs/p2panda-auth/latest/p2panda_auth/)
and [encryption scheme](https://docs.rs/p2panda-encryption/latest/p2panda_encryption/).
