This crate provides an API for managing scoped message streams encrypted towards a dynamic group
of actors. The p2panda-encryption Data Encryption scheme is used for key agreement and group
management is achieved through an integration with p2panda-auth groups.

## Features

* Decentralized group key agreement with forward secrecy and encrypted messaging with
  post-compromise security
* Decentralized group management with robust conflict resolution strategies
* Private space identifiers
* Re-use of groups across encryption boundaries
* Nested groups allowing for modelling multi-device profiles
* Generic over message type

## Requirements

* Messages must be ordered according to causal relations
* Messages must be signed and verified
