This crate provides APIs to allow for efficient implementations of p2panda operations- and log stores. These persistence and query APIs are utilised by higher-level components of the p2panda stack, such
as `p2panda-sync` and `p2panda-stream`.

A SQLite3 and in-memory solution for both operation and log meta-data storage is provided.
