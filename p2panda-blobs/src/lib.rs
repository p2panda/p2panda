//! Blobs service offering storage, retrieval and synchronisation of content-addressed data.
//!
//! `p2panda-blobs` relies on the
//! [`iroh-blobs`](https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/index.html) crate and offers an API
//! to import blobs into a store and use the resulting BLAKE3 hashes to address them for downloads.
//! In-memory and filesystem-based store options are provided.
//!
//! The blobs service integrates with `p2panda-net` to provide a means of synchronising files
//! between devices using BLAKE3 verified streaming. Memory usage is generally low, even when
//! transferring very large files.
