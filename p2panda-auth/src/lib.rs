//! `p2panda-auth` provides decentralised group management with fine-grained, per-member
//! permissions.
//!
//! Once a group has been created, members can be added, removed, promoted and demoted. Each
//! member has an associated access level which can be used to determine their permissions. The
//! access levels are `Pull`, `Read`, `Write` and `Manage`. Each access level is a superset of the
//! lower levels and can be assigned an associated set of conditions; this allows fine-grained
//! partitioning of each access level. For example, `Read` conditions could be assigned with a
//! path to restrict access to areas of a dataset. Finally, only members with `Manage` access are
//! allowed to modify the group state by adding, removing, promoting or demoting other members.
//!
//! The access levels defined by `p2panda-auth` may prove useful when controlling replication of
//! datasets. Custom sync protocols can be defined which rely on group membership and access
//! levels to determine who to sync with and over which subsets of data. Access conditions can be
//! used to define application-layer specific access rules, for example when modelling moderation
//! rules or additional write checks. 
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! ### Eventually Consistent Group State
//!
//! Peers replicating group operations will all eventually arrive at the same group state, even
//! when operations are authored concurrently or received out of order. Resolution of conflicting
//! state happens automatically.
//!
//! ### Strict Group Modification
//!
//! Only operations authored by members with “manage” access level will be applied to the group
//! state.
//!
//! ### Customisable Concurrency Resolution
//!
//! A group operation "resolver" is used to decide which operations should be invalidated in
//! certain concurrent situations. While the default concurrency resolver follows a cautious
//! "strong removal" approach, alternative approaches can be realised using custom implementations
//! of the provided `Resolver` trait.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! ### Group Operations
//!
//! Group state is modified by the publication of group operations. Each operation is signed by
//! the author and includes an action, along with fields to define previous operations and other
//! dependencies. The previous field allows causal ordering of operations in relation to one
//! another and the dependencies field allows custom application logic to define relationships
//! between groups and group operations.
//!
//! ### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
//!
//! All operations comprising a group for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This data structure
//! allows for concurrent operations to published and later resolved by merging divergent states.
//!
//! ### Concurrency Resolution for Conflicting Operations
//!
//! Certain concurrent scenarios lead to group state conflicts which must be resolved. In such
//! cases, all operations in the DAG are walked in a depth-first search so that any "bubbles" of
//! concurrent operations may be identified. Resolution rules are then applied to the operations
//! in these bubbles in order to populate a filter of operations to be invalidated. Once the
//! offending operations have been invalidated, any dependent operations are then invalidated in
//! turn.
//!
//! The provided "strong removal" resolver defines the following rules:
//!
//! 1) Removal or demotion of a manager causes any concurrent actions by that member to be
//!    invalidated
//! 2) Mutual removals, where two managers remove or demote one another concurrently, are not
//!    invalidated; both removals are applied to the group state but any other concurrent actions
//!    by those members are invalidated
//! 3) Re-adds are allowed; if Alice removes Charlie then re-adds them, they are still a member of
//!    the group but all of their concurrent actions are invalidated
//! 4) Invalidation of transitive operations; invalidation of an operation due to the application
//!    of the aforementioned rules results in all dependent operations being invalidated
