/// Core auth protocol for maintaining group membership state in a distributed system. Group
/// members can be assigned different access levels, where only a sub-set of members can mutate
/// the state of the group itself.
///
/// The core data type is a Directed Acyclic Graph of `GroupControlMessage`s. Messages contain
/// group control messages which mutate the previous group state. Messages refer to the "previous"
/// state (set of graph tips) which the action they contain should be applied to; these references
/// make up the edges in the graph. Additionally, messages have a set of "dependencies" which
/// could be part of any auth sub-group.
///
/// A requirement of the protocol is that all messages are processed in partial-order. When using
/// a dependency graph structure (as is the case in this implementation) it is possible to achieve
/// partial-ordering by only processing a message once all it's dependencies have themselves been
/// processed.
///
/// Group state is maintained using a state-based CRDT `GroupMembersState`. Every time a message
/// is processed, a new state is generated and added to the map of all states. When a new message
/// is received, it's "previous" state is calculated and then the message applied, resulting in a
/// new state. This approach allows one to use the state-based CRDT `merge` method to combine
/// states from any points in the group history into a new state. This property is what allows us
/// to process messages in partial- rather than total-order.
///
/// Group membership rules are checked when an action is applied to the previous state, read more
/// in the `group_crdt` module.
///
/// This is an implementation of the `AuthGroup` trait which requires a `prepare` and `process`
/// method. This implementation allows for providing several generic parameters which allows for
/// integration into different systems and customization of how group change conflicts are
/// handled.
///
/// - Resolver (RS): contains logic for deciding when group state rebuilds are required, and how
///   concurrent actions are handled.
/// - Orderer (ORD): the orderer implements an approach to ordering messages, the protocol
///   requires that all messages are processed in partial-order, but exactly how this is achieved
///   is not specified.
/// - Group Store (GS): global store containing states for all known groups.
