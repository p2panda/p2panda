This crate provides a collection of various methods which help to decode, validate, order,
prune or store p2panda operations. More methods are planned in the future.

With the stream-based design it is easy to "stack" these methods on top of each other,
depending on the requirements of the application (or each "topic" data stream). Like this a
user can decide if they want to persist data or keep it "ephemeral", apply automatic pruning
techniques for outdated operations etc.
