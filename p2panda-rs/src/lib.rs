/// coming in via deserialization, constructors or (string) conversion.

    /// Validation error type.

/// Trait used by p2panda structs for human-facing functionality, like better readability.
///
/// Please note: Most structs already provide string representation methods which can be used for
/// debugging with additional type information (`Debug`) or lossless string representations of the
/// data (`Display`). `Display` implementations return a string which can safely be parsed back
/// into the struct again. `Human` takes a third approach which is potentially destructive and aims
/// at easier to read strings.
pub trait Human {
    /// Returns a shorter representation of the type.

    /// Since p2panda values can at times be very long (for example hashes) this method can be used
    /// to implement a shorter representation of the value, which is destructive but easier to read
    /// for humans (and not computers).

/// Init pretty_env_logger before the test suite runs to handle logging outputs.
///
/// We output log information using the `log` crate. In itself this doesn't print
/// out any logging information, library users can capture and handle the emitted logs
/// using a log handler. Here we use `pretty_env_logger` to handle logs emitted
/// while running our tests.
///
/// This will also capture and output any logs emitted from our dependencies. This behaviour
/// can be customised at runtime. With eg. `RUST_LOG=p2panda=info cargo t` or
/// `RUST_LOG=openmls=debug cargo t`.
///
/// The `ctor` crate is used to define a global constructor function. This method
/// will be run before any of the test suites.
