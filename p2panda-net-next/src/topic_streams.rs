//! Topic stream types and associated methods.
//!
//! Topic streams provide an interface for publishing messages into the network and receiving
//! messages from the network.
//!
//! Ephemeral streams are intended to be used for relatively short-lived messages without
//! persistence and catch-up of past state. In most cases, messages will only be received if they
//! were published after the subscription was created. The exception to this is if the message was
//! still propagating through the network at the time of the subscription; then it's possible that
//! the message is received, even though the publication time was strictly before that of the local
//! subscription event.
//!
//! Use the standard topic stream if you wish to receive past state and (optionally) messages
//! representing the latest updates in an ongoing manner.
