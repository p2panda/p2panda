This repository will eventually contain all sorts of building blocks you can
use to write offline-first applications with: Core data types for
collaboration, fine-grained permissions, group encryption, efficient
replication, p2p networking and privacy-respecting deletion.

> Check out the [`v1`](https://github.com/p2panda/p2panda/tree/v1) branch and
> [`aquadoggo`](https://github.com/p2panda/aquadoggo/) for a less modular, more
> opiniated, but fully functional implementation of p2panda.
