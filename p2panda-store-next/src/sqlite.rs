/// SQLite database with connection pool and transaction provider.

/// This struct can be cloned and used in multiple places in the application. Every cloned instance
/// will re-use the same connection pool and have access to the same transaction instance if one
/// was started. To guard against sharing transactions unknowingly across unrelated database
/// queries, a concept of a `TransactionPermit` was introduced which does not protect from misuse
/// but helps to make "holding" a transaction explicit.
///
/// Please note that SQLite strictly serializes transactions with _writes_ and will block any
/// parallel attempt to begin another one. Processes starting a transaction will acquire a
/// `TransactionPermit` and keep it until the transaction was committed or rolled back. If the
/// query only involves _reads_ it is recommended to not use transactions and use the `execute`
/// method directly as acquiring transactions will potentially block other processes to do work.
///
/// ## Design decisions
///
/// This storage API design was chosen to make the dynamics of the underlying SQLite database
/// explicit to avoid potentially introducing subtle bugs. Internally any process can access the
/// transaction object to do writes and (uncommitted) reads (see "Transaction I" in diagram). Care
/// is required when designing systems like that as it's still possible to allow concurrent
/// processes to read and write within the same transaction (for example one process could roll
/// back the transaction while the other one assumed it will be committed). Usually developers want
/// to design _writes_ to the database within a transaction if they need consistency and atomicity
/// guarantees. "Unrelated" queries _can_ be "pooled" in one transaction (for performance reasons
/// for example) if consistency is guaranteed by all involved processes and the underlying
/// data-model (see "Transaction II" in diagram).
///
/// ```text
/// Transaction I:
/// begin ---------------------> commit
///
/// Process I:
///       --> write --> read -->
///
///                                             Transaction II:
///                                             begin ----------------------> commit
///
///                                             Process II:
///                                                   --> write --> write -->
///
///                                             Process III:
///                                                   --> read --> write --->
/// ```
///
/// Another design decision is to not expose transactions to the high-level storage APIs (similar
/// to the "Repository Pattern"). Users of the storage methods like `get_operation` (in
/// `OperationStore`) etc. do _not_ need to explicity deal with transaction objects, as this is
/// handled internally now. Like this it is possible to separate the "logic" from the "storage"
/// layer and keep the code clean.
