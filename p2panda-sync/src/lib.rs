//! Data- and transport-agnostic interface to implement custom sync protocols, compatible with
//! `p2panda-net` or other peer-to-peer networking solutions.
//!
//! Sync or "synchronisation" protocols (also known as "replication protocols") are used to
//! efficiently exchange data between peers.
//!
//! Unlike gossip protocols, sync protocols are better solutions to "catch up on past state". Peers
//! can negotiate scope and access in a sync protocol for any type of data the remote peer
//! currently knows about.
//!
//! In addition to the generic definition of the `SyncProtocol` trait, `p2panda-sync` includes
//! optional implementations for efficient sync of append-only log-based data types. These optional
//! implementations may be activated via feature flags. Finally, `p2panda-sync` provides helpers to
//! encode wire messages in CBOR.

/// Traits to implement a custom sync protocol.
///
/// Implementing a `SyncProtocol` trait needs extra care and is only required when designing custom
/// low-level peer-to-peer protocols and data types. p2panda already comes with solutions which can
/// be used "out of the box", providing implementations for most applications and usecases.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// Sync sessions take place when two peers connect to each other and follow the sync protocol.
/// They are designed as a two-party protocol featuring an "initiator" and an "acceptor" role.
///
/// Each protocol usually follows two phases: 1) The "Handshake" phase, during which the
/// "initiator" sends the "topic query" and any access control data to the "acceptor", and 2) The
/// "Sync" phase, where the requested application data is finally exchanged and validated.
///
/// ## Privacy and Security
///
/// The `SyncProtocol` trait has been designed to allow privacy-respecting implementations where
/// application data (via access control) and the topic query itself (for example via Diffie
/// Hellmann) is securely exchanged without revealing any information to unknown peers
/// unnecessarily. This usually takes place during the "Handshake" phase of the protocol.
///
/// The underlying transport layer should provide automatic authentication of the remote peer, a
/// reliable connection and transport encryption. `p2panda-net`, for example, uses self-certified
/// TLS 1.3 over QUIC.
///
/// ## Streams
///
/// Three distinct data channels are provided by the underlying transport layer to each
/// `SyncProtocol` implementation: `tx` for sending data to the remote peer, `rx` to receive data
/// from the remote peer and `app_tx` to send received data to the higher-level application-,
/// validation- and persistance-layers.
///
/// ## Topic queries
///
/// Topics queries are generic data types which can be used to subjectively express interest in a
/// particular subset of the data we want to sync over, like chat group identifiers or very
/// specific "search queries", for example "give me all documents containing the word 'billy'."
///
/// With the help of the `TopicMap` trait we can keep sync implementations agnostic to specific
/// topic query implementations. The sync protocol only needs to feed the "topic query" into the
/// "map" which will answer with the actual to-be-synced data entities (for example coming from a
/// store). This allows application developers to re-use your `SyncProtocol` implementation for
/// their custom `TopicQuery` requirements.
///
/// ## Validation
///
/// Basic data-format and -encoding validation usually takes place during the "Sync" phase of the
/// protocol.
///
/// Further validation which might require more knowledge of the application state or can only be
/// applied after decrypting the payload should be handled _outside_ the sync protocol, by sending
/// it upstream to higher application layers.
///
/// ## Errors
///
/// Protocol implementations operate on multiple layers at the same time, expressed in distinct
/// error categories:
///
/// 1. Unexpected behaviour of the remote peer not following the implemented protocol
/// 2. Handling (rare) critical system failures
